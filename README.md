### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

1. To get started copy the repo:

```
git clone <Repo URL>.git
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. Install the project packages:
=======
1.  Anyone can contribute to this Freecodecamp website but you must first get permission from a Project Director or Project Manager.  When approved, you will be added to a NashvilleFCC2020WebDevs Team that has been put together to develop and maintain the site.
>>>>>>> 7f3ef0a2acd5a8b57f9454b9ec02bcf101ef3aeb

```
npm install
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
3. Run the server:

```
npm start
```

## Contributing

Review the following docs before diving in:
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
=======
3.  One review is Required on pull requests to be merged to master.  Currently, the only people allowed to dismiss pull requests/merge to master are: Laura Pinell, John Hellrung or Joy Ittycheriah.  To minimize merge conflicts, please inform the team in the Discord Channel set-up for this project (#2020-fcc-nashville-website) when you/we have a new Master.  In addition, please inform the team on this Discord channel when you have a pull request waiting as well.  To access the correct Discord Server, use:  https://discord.gg/gugduRM

4.  Some tickets have been completed.  More tickets are forthcoming.  If you select a ticket from the To Do column, please click the right upper corner of the card/note, choose <edit note> and add your name as the person working on the ticket and click save.  Then move the card/note to the In Progress column by dragging the card/note.  In addition, you can assign yourself to any item in the Backlog column by clicking on the link, scrolling down to Assignees and adding your name.  Thanks!

5.  The backlog column may contain items that may be too large to finish as a single ticket item.  Therefore, it is HIGHLY recommended that you initiate multiple tickets for any single item in the backlog column.  When ALL tickets related to the Backlog item in question have been completed, then the item in the Backlog column can be moved directly to the completed column as well.  This, of course, means that no items from backlog column should be moved to the Completed column without making sure that all sub-items related to it have been completed first.

6.  Please add comments (within your codebase) on each section of code BEFORE you pull request it so that a reviewer can do a better job of reviewing/understanding your code and approving it.  The word "section" in the previous sentence is subjective.  In addition, add in-line comments within your code when possible to explain hard-to-understand concepts or anything that may confuse a future code reviewer/maintainer.

7.  Fix merge conflicts LOCALLY before you push up a branch and place a pull request on the branch.  If you have fixed merge conflicts or have other related comments on the pull request, please enter detailed comments on it when requesting the pull request on the branch.  Of course, if you have merge conflicts you were not expecting or don't know which version to keep/throw away, it is best to resolve that through communication on our Discord channel before you commit and push up a branch.

=======
By fixing merge conflicts LOCALLY (see above), I mean that:

A.  Add and Commit your existing branch.
B.  Checkout to the Master branch locally.
C.  Pull down the latest Master.
D.  Checkout to your branch.
E.  Type "git merge master"
F.  Type code . to review any potential merge conflicts. (Assuming you are using VS Code as your Interactive Development Environment)

## Code/Frameworks/Libraries Used in this project

1.  The project was initiated with the Create React App command (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
2.  Then installed a package using the following command on the command line:  npm install --save react-render-html.
3. Mockoon is used to create a mock server for the API. Simply import
the mockoonAPI.json file into Mockoon and it will create a testable server
to access the information as it were from an official API.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Information Related to using the React framework

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
