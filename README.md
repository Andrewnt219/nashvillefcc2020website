Please use the Issues tab on GitHub to request features or report bugs.  The Projects tab contains the current status of the code changes and updates to this project.

## How to Contribute

First of all, thank-you for wanting to contribute!  For those who have volunteered to work with me on this project, please create a directory on your hard drive and then clone down the project.  Make sure to create a feature branch to work on (don't work on the Master copy please!). My feature branch names will be like this:  joy0227addimage (the 0227 is the date that I initiated that code).  Please name your branches in a similar pattern so that I can tell whose code, when it was generated and what feature you worked on when we are looking at your pull requests.  If you aren't familiar with git or don't know what I'm talking about, I will be happy to get with you to explain how to make this work.

Sincerely,

Joy Ittycheriah

## Information Related to using the React framework

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
