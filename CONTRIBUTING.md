## What should I know before I get started?

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### Note: This done mean you need to expect but basic understanding and experience will work.

## How to Contribute Code on this Project

First of all, thank-you for wanting to contribute! For those who have volunteered to work with me on this project, please create a directory on your hard drive and then clone down the project. Make sure to create a feature branch to work on (don't work on the Master copy please!). My feature branch names will be like this: joy0227addimage (the 0227 is the date that I initiated that code). Please name your branches in a similar pattern so that I can tell whose code, when it was generated and what feature you worked on when we are looking at your pull requests. If you aren't familiar with git or don't know what I'm talking about, I will be happy to get with you to explain how to make this work.

Sincerely,

Joy Ittycheriah

## Coding Guidelines/Remarks

Anyone can contribute to this Freecodecamp website but you must first get permission from a Project Director or Project Manager. When approved, you will be added to a NashvilleFCC2020WebDevs Team that has been put together to develop and maintain the site.

To request features/report bugs/better the UI/UX use the issues tab on GitHub to add a new issue.

One review is Required on pull requests to be merged to master. Currently, the only people allowed to dismiss pull requests/merge to master are: Laura Pinell, John Hellrung or Joy Ittycheriah. To minimize merge conflicts, please inform the team in the Discord Channel set-up for this project (#2020-fcc-nashville-website) when you/we have a new Master. In addition, please inform the team on this Discord channel when you have a pull request waiting as well. To access the correct Discord Server, use: https://discord.gg/gugduRM

Some tickets have been completed. More tickets are forthcoming. If you select a ticket from the To Do column, please click the right upper corner of the card/note, choose and add your name as the person working on the ticket and click save. Then move the card/note to the In Progress column by dragging the card/note. In addition, you can assign yourself to any item in the Backlog column by clicking on the link, scrolling down to Assignees and adding your name. Thanks!

The backlog column may contain items that may be too large to finish as a single ticket item. Therefore, it is HIGHLY recommended that you initiate multiple tickets for any single item in the backlog column. When ALL tickets related to the Backlog item in question have been completed, then the item in the Backlog column can be moved directly to the completed column as well. This, of course, means that no items from backlog column should be moved to the Completed column without making sure that all sub-items related to it have been completed first.

Please add comments (within your codebase) on each section of code BEFORE you pull request it so that a reviewer can do a better job of reviewing/understanding your code and approving it. The word "section" in the previous sentence is subjective. In addition, add in-line comments within your code when possible to explain hard-to-understand concepts or anything that may confuse a future code reviewer/maintainer.

Fix merge conflicts LOCALLY before you push up a branch and place a pull request on the branch. If you have fixed merge conflicts or have other related comments on the pull request, please enter detailed comments on it when requesting the pull request on the branch. Of course, if you have merge conflicts you were not expecting or don't know which version to keep/throw away, it is best to resolve that through communication on our Discord channel before you commit and push up a branch.

Just as importantly, make sure that you have merged the most up-to-date master branch into your branch and checked for conflicts before you push up a branch.

By fixing merge conflicts LOCALLY (see above), I mean that:

A. Add and Commit your existing branch. B. Checkout to the Master branch locally. C. Pull down the latest Master. D. Checkout to your branch. E. Type "git merge master" F. Type code . to review any potential merge conflicts. (Assuming you are using VS Code as your Interactive Development Environment)

### Questions about the source code?

Feel free to ask [Hellrung](https://github.com/Hellrungj) or [lapinell](https://github.com/lapinell)

### Branches

Branches name should be named with the follow standard:
```
Ticket Number -> Ticket Name

Examle: 01_Update_README
```

### Pull Requests

There must be a Pull Request or every change to repo.

#### Note: Make sure you compare the nashvillefcc/UndergroundJS-Website Master Branch to Your Branch

Assign [Hellrungj](https://github.com/Hellrungj) as Pull Request Reviewer
